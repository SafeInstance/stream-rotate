# Stream Rotate

Implements a stream interface that allows log rotation. Manages streams and files automatically.

## Features

## Installation

```bash

npm install stream-rotate
```

## Usage

```js

var rotator = require('stream-rotate');

logstream = rotator({
    path: '/logs'
  , name: 'myapp'
  , size: '1m'
  , retention: 2
  });
  
logstream = new rotator({...});

logstream.on('error', function(err){
  // handle errors here
});  

logstream.on('rotated',function () {
        console.log('The log file was just rotated');
    });


```

### Express

```

app.use(express.logger({stream: logstream, format: "default"}));
```

### Winston

```js

winston.add(winston.transports.File, {
  stream: logstream
});
```

__note__: This is important since winston does not provide rotation on streams nor options for setting the encoding, mode or flag of the file.


## API

### Stream-Rotate

Returns a file stream that auto rotates based on size or date.

When a current log file is no longer valid (too big or old) then it is moved. The format of that new file is as follows.

{name}\_MMDDYY\_HHMMSS.{ext}

#### Options

  - `path`: {String}
  - `name`: {String}
  - `ext`: {String} (default: 'log')
  - `size`: {Number} Max file size in bytes (optional)
  - `freq`: {} (optional)
  - `retention`: {Number} (default: 2)
  - `poll`: {Number} (default: null) 
  - `compress`: {Boolean} {default: false}
  - `flags`: {String} (default: 'a')
  - `encoding`: {Mixed} (default: null)
  - `mode`: {Number} (default: 0600)

##### path
  Directory to store log files.
  
##### name
  Root name of the file
  
##### ext
  extension for the log file (default: 'log')
  
##### size
  Accepts {Number} or {String}. If string, it must start with a number and have one of the following characters appended.
  
  - `k`: converts to kilobyte(s)
  - `m`: converts to megabyte(s)
  - `g`: coverts to gigabyte(s)

##### freq
  Accepts a {Number} or {String}. If string, it must start with a number ahnd have one of the following characters appended:
  
  - `s`: sets unit to second(s)
  - `m`: sets unit to minutes(s)
  - `h`: sets unit to hour(s)
  - `d`: sets unit to day(s)
  - `w`: sets unit to week(s)
  - `M`: sets unit to month(s)
  - `y`: sets unit to year(s)

__note__: if {Number} expected unit is in seconds.

Calculations are done based on the creation time of the current file. If the time is exceeded then the file is rotated.

##### retention
  Number of log files to retain. This does not include the current. default = 2. This means a maximum of 3 files can exist.


##### poll
  Option to poll file with fs.Stats. This is only needed when `stream-rotator` does not have exclusive access to the file (default) and other applications could be writing to the file at the same time and your relying on the `size` option. 
  
This is needed because `stream-rotate` relies on getting the file size when the stream is opened and incrementing the size based on the Buffer.length when writes are performed.

If set it should be a {Number} in seconds. 

##### compress
  compress the files (default: false)
  
  __note__: not implemented yet.

##### flags
  A flag used with [fs.open](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_open_path_flags_mode_callback). defaults to 'a'.
  
  __note__: needs to be a writable option.
  
##### encoding
  Set the encoding for the stream. defaults to `null` (Buffer). If set to a string it needs to be one of the [supported encodings](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer).
  
##### mode
  Set the permissions on the fs.writestream. default = 0600
  

## TODO

  - implement readable stream interface
  - robust options on log naming
  - implement compression
  - integration testing
